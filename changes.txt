* DelegatingSubject is now still usable after it is logged out (no invalid exceptions thrown).
  The Subject is now just considered 'anonymous' again at that point.

* ReflectionBuilder (used in JSecurity .ini and web.xml based text configuration) now handles setting
  primitive attributes correctly, performing proper string-to-primitive conversion (BeanUtils does this automatically).

* ReflectionBuilder (used for JSecurity .ini and web.xml configuration) now supports setting other previously configured
  objects by '$' reference. For example:
  bar = some.package.class.Bar
  foo = some.package.class.Foo
  foo.bar = $bar
